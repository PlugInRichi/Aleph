PyTorch does not distribute the CPU only versions over PyPI. They are only available through their custom registry.

If you select the CPU only version on PyTorch - Get Started Locally you get the following instructions:

pip install torch==1.5.0+cpu torchvision==0.6.0+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

Since you're not manually executing the pip install, you cannot simply add the -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html.

As an alternative, you can put it into your requirements.txt as a standalone line. It shouldn't really matter where exactly you put it, but it is commonly put at the very top.

-f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

¿Qué hac eel comando -f al ejecutarlo con pip?
